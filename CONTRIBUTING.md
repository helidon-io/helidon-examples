# Contributing

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Discussions

Join us at [#helidon-users](http://slack.helidon.io) and participate in discussions.

## Opening Issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/issues) unless it's
security related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,
the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Contributing code

We welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code via a pull request,
you will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and
your commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail
address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`
or `-s`, e.g.

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA
can be accepted.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure there is an issue created to track and discuss the fix or enhancement
   you intend to submit.
1. Fork this repository
1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using
   the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly
   what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate
   your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well.
